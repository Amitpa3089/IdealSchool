            <h1>Counselling Room</h1>
            <p>
                School counselors are vital members of the education team at Ideal International School. 
                They help all the students in the areas of academic achievement, career, social and emotional development, 
                ensuring todayâ€™s students become the productive, well-adjusted adults of tomorrow. The School Counselor offers 
                guidance to individuals and groups who are dealing with issues that affect their mental health and well-being and 
                help them to define goals, plan action and gain insight. Counselors also encourage students to talk to their parents 
                or guardians about the things that they are worried about. When students do not feel comfortable talking about emotional
                 or social problems at home, school counselors have individual counseling sessions with them. If there is a problem occurring 
                 with a group of students, a group counseling session is warranted. Sometimes counselors include the parents in these sessions 
                 for serious issues to determine whether outside counseling or support is necessary.<br><br>

                Some of specific areas taken care by school counselor are:-
