            <h1>Montessori Classroom</h1>
            <p>
                A Montessori curriculum focuses on key developmental milestones in children 
                between the ages of three and five – years-old. When children are finished
                 with an activity, they place items back into their right places. This sense
                  of order helps to facilitate the learning process, teaches self – discipline, 
                  and caters to a young child’s innate need for an orderly environment. Teachers 
                  take the lead from the children in the classroom, ensure the ground rules
                   are followed and encourage students to perform tasks at their own pace. 
                   Children work at tasks for the joy of the work, rather than the end result, 
                   which allows them to focus more on process than result – a natural path to 
                   creativity.<br><br>
