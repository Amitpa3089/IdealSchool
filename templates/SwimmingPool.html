            <h1>Swimming Pool</h1>
            <p>
                Water activities are termed as best of all activities which 
                provide complete exercise to whole body. Ideal International 
                campus is facilitated with the indoor swimming pool along with 
                filter plant. The size of our swimming pool is 82 x 27 feet i.e.
                 as per the Olympic norms.<br><br>

                The most obvious benefit of having an indoor pool is that it 
                will provide with an all-weather recreation area. This can 
                definitely provide better swimming experience throughout the 
                year. This means maximising the use of swimming pool for our students.
                <br><br>

                Another advantage of having an indoor pool is not exposed to 
                outside debris and dust that is normally blown into an outdoor
                 pool. Because of this, it ensures the clean water for swimming
                  of students and no harm from UV rays of sunlight and its 
                  extreme heat.
