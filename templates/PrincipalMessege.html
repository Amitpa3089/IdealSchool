                As the proud Principal & Director of this institution, I
                 warmly welcome you to the website of an <b>academically high 
                 school of Indore with the legacy of excellence</b> in schooling 
                 from 21 years, IDEAL INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL.<br><br>

                When students graduate from the <b>best school</b>, their entry 
                into the world should be so smooth that nary a ripple should 
                mar the transition from adolescence to adulthood; it should 
                be so impactful that it touches the lives of multitudes; and 
                it should be so unique that it remains etched in the minds of 
                those who revelled in it.<br><br>
                
                This is the dream that we at Ideal International School have 
                for our students. We want to prepare them so that they can 
                face challenges with aplomb and accept success with humility. 
                We want them to experience the real joy of living not just 
                obtain a vicarious knowledge of it through books. We want 
                them to be known as honourable players and not just winners, 
                as wise and not just intelligent, as understanding and not
                 just knowledgeable, as kind and compassionate and not just 
                 friendly.<br><br>
                
                <b>Life at Ideal International School</b>, It is an exciting journey
                 which begins when children enter its portals and step into 
                 the intricate domain of the scholar. Along with mastery of 
                 the various areas of academics, we encourage them to enjoy 
                 and excel in <b>best playground</b> and Fields of <b>sports</b> and other 
                 <b>co-curricular activities</b>. They are guided to learn the art 
                 of governance by organising events and donning the mantle 
                 of student leaders. They are taught to be independent in 
                 thought, but to act within the framework of decorum and 
                 respect for others.<br><br>
                
                We applaud those high achievers who bring fame to the school 
                with their achievements in scholastic and non-scholastic 
                areas. But it is those students who embody the values of 
                selflessness, tolerance, honesty and integrity who are 
                remembered much after they have left school and who leave an 
                indelible imprint in the annals of the history of the school 
                for they have chosen a far more arduous path to follow; one of 
                self-discipline, which is replete with the principles an 
                ordinary person may find difficult to follow. This is who a 
                true Idealite is: A student who has the ability to triumph in 
                any field he chooses and whose exemplary values place him far 
                
                above the others in his area of expertise. It matters that 
                that alumni of Ideal International School become trailblazers
                 and that our students bring laurels to the school, but What
                  matters more is that they become good human beings.<br><br>
                
                I would like to conclude with a message for my students
                The secret of success lies in your own happiness and well being.
