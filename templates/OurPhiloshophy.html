            <h1>Our Philoshophy</h1>
            <p>
                Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. aptly describes the function of education as,
                 “to teach one to think intensively, and to think critically.
                  Intelligence plus character – that is the goal of true education.”<br><br>

                 In our School, the teaching is not about knowledge transfer, but fostering excellence.
                  We believe in opening the minds of the pupils. We guide them to learn by doing, 
                  stressing on the all-round development of child’s personality.<br><br>

                    As rightly said by John F. Kennedy, “Education is a means of developing our greatest
                  abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which,
                   fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater 
                   strength for our nation.” At Ideal International School, this is what we 
                   strive for, as quality is never an accident, it is always the result of 
                   intelligent effort. Hard work is the key to our high standards. Here, the
                    education is child-centered, and aims at comprehensive all-round 
                    development of children. So, teaching styles and techniques are geared 
                    to the well-being of the child which leads to his cognitive, effective 
                    and curative development.<br><br>

                The School provides exposure, training and platform through various clubs to showcase 
                their talents. Whether it is dance, music, drama or sports, children are 
                given ample opportunities to identify and develop their abilities and 
                areas of interest. The goal is not to help each child make a career out 
                of his/her talent but to get in touch with his/her inner creativity.<br><br>

                “The Education system provides space to students to develop their own talents as well
                 as to be aware of national and global issues, while contributing to the healthy 
                 development of needs of the community.”
