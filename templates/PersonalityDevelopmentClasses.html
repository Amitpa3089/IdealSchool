            <h1>Personality Development Classes</h1>
            <p>
                We are focusing on providing quality education to children of
                 our school but the students seem to lack confidence when it 
                 comes to public speaking, interaction and spoken English. 
                 These special classes are a step towards personality 
                 development of our students. Various types of activities are 
                 organised in these special classes including classes on 
                 general knowledge, moral values, spoken English and 
                 competitions like speech, debate, extempore and much more 
                 which help students to get rid of stage fear and fear of 
                 public speaking, making them more confident.
