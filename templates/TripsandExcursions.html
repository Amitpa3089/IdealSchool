            <h1>Trips and Excursions</h1>
            <p>
                Travelling is the best way of learning. We believe that trips 
                and excursions are a perfect way to expand oneâ€™s horizons. This is the 
                reason we organise regular excursions for students to promote learning
                 through outdoor interactions and experiences. In addition such trips 
                 also instil a sense of appreciation for the wonders of the earth and 
                 expose one to a wide variety of cultural diversity and geographical 
                 ecosystems.<br><br>

                Another important objective of planning trips is to provide an
                 opportunity to teachers as well as students to bond with each other,
                  giving both the parties a break from their hectic schedules.
