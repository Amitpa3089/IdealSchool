            <h1>Transport Facility</h1>
            <p>
                Ensuring safe transportation is our first priority as services 
                to the parents with assurance as per the entire required 
                guidelines . A fleet of buses provides the facility of commuting
                 between home and school to those who wish to avail it. The 
                 buses ply on fixed routes and stop at fixed places only. 
                 Factors taken into account while deciding the routes and the 
                 bus stops are: space availability for U-turn instead of moving 
                 the bus in reverse direction, safe stop over a place where 
                 students can board and alight comfortably without any risk, 
                 number of students from a particular area, convenient to 
                 maximum number of students. And, since the institute is 
                 located in the city therefore least travel time is one big 
                 aspect for our students as well as the parents.
