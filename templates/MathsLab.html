            <p>
                School has established a well equipped Mathematics Laboratory. It is a place where learning becomes fun. The laboratory 
                approach of teaching mathematics provides students with the opportunity to understand and discover the beauty, importance
                 and relevance of mathematics as a discipline. The Math Lab comprises of a variety of mathematical teaching aids in the 
                 form of models, games, charts, CDs, books etc. useful for effective learning.<br><br>


                The focus of learning is on developing number sense, spatial sense, recognition of patterns and gradually to attend the problems with algorithm and abstraction. Teachers emphasize on mathematical process which helps the child to imbibe concepts using concrete materials, problem solving with real-life situations, reasoning, reflecting and connecting, selecting appropriate computational tool, strategies and use of mathematical vocabulary.
