                 I came across this amazing quote suddenly when I was looking
                 for some information in the internet and realized how relevant
                  it is for all of us: children, parents and teachers. There 
                  is no point in the life of a person when he can say. “There 
                  is nothing more to learn, I can relax with the comforting 
                  thought that the universe around me is an open book. I know 
                  it all.” <br> <br> is not just about the subjects that are learnt 
                    and taught in schools. Becoming educated is not restricted
                     to being in school and then in college, gathering 
                     certificates and feeling proud of oneself. It is a 
                     lifelong exercise that can be unbelievably exciting if 
                     only we wish to jump onto the train of experience and
                      take a trip to every conceivable place on the earth. 
                      Now we know that this cannot be done literally, so how
                       do we manage it, first in school and then as we go on 
                       through the passage of life?</p>
            <p>First, we all have to be on the same page: children, teachers and
                 parents have to understand that education is not restricted to
                  lessons taught in the classroom from text books. Parents and 
                  teachers must encourage children to ask as many questions as
                   they can. For it is in a wanting to know that will result in 
                   actually getting to know.</p>
            <p>The thirst for knowledge is not restricted to the child. It is 
                also essential for a parent and a teacher to keep adding to their 
                own knowledge bank by keeping their eyes and ears open and by 
                reading as much as possible and ensuring that children develop
                 these habits as well.</p>
            <p>“I received the fundamentals of my education in school, but 
                that was not enough. My real education, the superstructure, 
                the details, the true architecture, I got out of the public 
                library. For an impoverished child whose family could not
                 afford to buy books, the library was the open door to wonders
                  and achievements,and I can never be sufficiently grateful 
                  that I had the wit to charge through that and make the most
                   of it.”- Isaac Asimov <br><br>

                Besides all of the above, that add to children becoming truly  
                educated, schools and teachers must ensure that children have a
                 society of enriching experiences. Surprisingly, these 
                 experiences develop a child’s creativity and imagination 
                 and lead to something that is often thought to be more 
                 important than knowledge. Creativity and imagination make
                  children grow up to be productive adults who then arrive 
                  as citizens of the world ready to make their own great 
                  contribution to mankind. <br><br>

                
                “Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge 
                is limited to all we now know and understand, while imaginati
                on embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to 
                know and understand. “ – Albert Einstein <br><br>

                
                My message to the Principal, Staff, Students and esteemed 
                Parents of Ideal International Schools, is to dedicate this
                 year to a correct understanding of what education really 
                 means and let us all benefit from this understanding.</p>
            <p>God bless us all and help us achieve success in our endeavours.</p>
